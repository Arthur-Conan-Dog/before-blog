## Basics of how it works

From: https://dev.to/lydiahallie/javascript-visualized-the-javascript-engine-4cdf

1. The script gets loaded as a UTF-16 byte stream from either the network, cache, or a worker, and passed it to the byte stream decoder.

2. The byte stream decoder decodes the bytes into tokens. The tokens are sent to the parser.

  The engine uses two parsers: the pre-parser, and the parser. The pre-parser only checks the tokens early to see if there are any syntactical errors.

3. The parser generates nodes based on the tokens, and creates an Abstract Syntax Tree.

4. The interpreter walks through the AST and generates byte code.

5. The byte code and type feedback are sent to the optimizing compiler, which generates highly optimized machine code.

  JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning that the types of data can change constantly. It would be extremely slow if the JavaScript engine had to check each time which data type a certain value has.
  
  Instead, the engine uses a technique called inline caching. It caches the code in memory, in the hope that it will return the same value with the same behavior in the future.
