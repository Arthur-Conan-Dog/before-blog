# [You and Your Research](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)

This talk is about how you individually do your research, not ordinary run-of-the-mill research, but great research.

"Luck favors the prepared mind." Great science needs a bit of luck, but it is not all a matter of luck.

One of the characteristics of successful scientists is having courage. They will go forward under incredible circumstances; they think and continue to think. Once you get your courage up and believe that you can do important problems, then you can. If you think you can't, almost surely you are not going to.

They always are saying that you have got to do it when you are young or you will never do it. But let me say why age seems to have the effect it does. In the first place if you do some good work you will find yourself on all kinds of committees and unable to do any more work.

"Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest." Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest.

You have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.

"Creativity comes out of your subconscious." Somehow, suddenly, there it is. It just appears. Well, we know very little about the subconscious; but one thing you are pretty well aware of is that your dreams also come out of your subconscious. And you're aware your dreams are, to a fair extent, a reworking of the experiences of the day. If you are deeply immersed and committed to a topic, day after day after day, your subconscious has nothing to do but work on your problem. And so you wake up one morning, or on some afternoon, and there's the answer. So the way to manage yourself is that when you have a real important problem you don't let anything else get the center of your attention - you keep your thoughts on the problem. Keep your subconscious starved so it has to work on your problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer in the morning, free.

If you do not work on an important problem, it's unlikely you'll do important work. If what you are doing is not important, and if you don't think it is going to lead to something important, why are you working on it?

The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind.

Life is a long sequence of one problem after another after another. You should be in the mass production of a variable product, and be concerned with all of next year's problems, not just the one in front of your face.

Most people like to believe something is or is not true. Great scientists tolerate ambiguity very well. They believe the theory enough to go ahead; they doubt it enough to notice the errors and faults so they can step forward and create the new replacement theory. If you believe too much you'll never notice the flaws; if you doubt too much you won't get started. It requires a lovely balance.

It is not sufficient to do a job, you have to sell it. There are three things you have to do in selling. You have to learn to write clearly and well so that people will read it, you must learn to give reasonably formal talks, and you also must learn to give informal talks.

Why do so many of the people who have great promise, fail?

  1. Drive and commitment. The people who do great work with less ability but who are committed to it, get more done that those who have great skill and dabble in it.
  
  2. The problem of personality defects. Good scientists will fight the system rather than learn to work with the system and take advantage of all the system has to offer. It has a lot, if you learn how to use it. It takes patience, but you can learn how to use the system pretty well, and you can learn how to get around it.
  
  3. Anger.

  4. Look for the negative side of things instead of the positive. You need to know how to convert a situation from one view to another which would increase the chance of success.

If you really want to be a first-class scientist you need to know yourself, your weaknesses, your strengths, and your bad faults.
